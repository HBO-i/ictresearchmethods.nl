			"An activity plan.",
			"A shared problem statement and rules.",

		"why": "Maximize the outcome of your efforts or investment.",
		"how": "Analyse the most viable options or scenarios for your problem or opportunity. In doing so, calculate the ‘value’ of each scenario and define the risks involved. Identify the type of value your project will deliver (e.g. cost reduction, revenue generation, risk reduction or regulatory compliance). Take all costs and revenues into account. Some revenues or outcomes are more difficult to quantify but should also be considered. Recognise that future costs and gains may be lowered due to inflation and interest (e.g. by calculating ‘net present value’).",
		"practice": "Most companies only detail the one or two most viable business cases.",

			"Take all costs and revenues into account.",
			"Some revenues or outcomes are more difficult to quantify but should be taken into account as well.",
			"Take into account that costs and gains in future weight lower due to inflation and interest (e.g. by calculating net present value)",
			"Use a tool or template like Business Model Canvas."

		"name": "Code review",
		"why": "With many eyeballs on the code, all bugs are shallow. Colleagues can help you find bugs and improve the quality of your source code.",
		"how": "Code reviews can be done in many ways. The code can be presented on a big screen, so the entire team can do the review together. You can also ask one or two peers to simply sit behind your desk while you talk them through your code. Code analysis can also be a part of the workflow (e.g. every commit must be reviewed by someone else).",
		"practice": "Code review sessions are often incorporated into software development projects. In Scrum, code reviews can be part of the ‘definition of done’. Pair programming can also be an effective way to let your work be continuously reviewed by a peer.",
		"ingredients": [
			"Peers with a critical view.",
			"A willingness to improve weak points in your code.",
			"Code standards, a code style guide, checklists, etc."

		"name": "Decomposition",
		"why": "Breaking a complex IT system or problem into smaller parts ensures its maintainability and robustness, and facilitates cooperation in large-scale software projects.",
		"how": "Create a model of your system by breaking it into components, and then defining relationships. You can define models from different perspectives (e.g. static, dynamic and physical views).",
		"practice": "Large companies use a wide repertoire of techniques (e.g. UML, SysML, C4 Model), while smaller companies often use a subset of these techniques. The extent to which these techniques are used depends on the needs in a project and can differ for various parts of the software.",
		"ingredients": [
			"A ‘divide and conquer’ mindset.",
			"An appropriate modelling technique, like UML.",
			"Knowledge of some (not all) of the requirements.",
			"Knowledge of the end system and what changes are expected in the future (variation points)."

		"practice": "A gap analysis is often performed before developing a new product. An identified gap can be used as an opportunity in a SWOT analysis.",

		"practice": "Most companies use architecture sketching at the beginning of the design process, and as a kick-off for major changes to a part of the architecture.",
		"ingredients": [
			"The appropriate people (3–5 people with the required expertise is ideal).",
			"An understanding of the top-level requirements before starting.",
			"A whiteboard and markers.",
			"A camera to photograph the resulting sketch to detail later."
