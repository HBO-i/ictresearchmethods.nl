name: "Root cause analysis"
why: "Understand why a problem occurs and prevent it from happening again."
how: "Systematically identify the possible factors that could have led to the problem. For each factor, determine whether it is symptom of a deeper cause. Classify the factors and define measures to prevent the problem from happening again. Do not stop too quickly; ensure that there is no deeper cause."
practice: "Companies use many techniques (e.g. fishbone diagram, problem tree, 5x why). One example is a software company that put more and more effort into testing because of bad product quality. By using 5X Why, they discovered that the root cause was over-optimistic scheduling that led to stress for the developers."
ingredients: [
"A structured approach.",
"No initial bias about possible causes or solutions.",
"A diverse group of knowledge holders to help (e.g. security, software, business, user perspective)."
