<h1>About</h1>
<p>
	As an ICT student or professional, you need to solve all kind of ICT challenges. Answering the
	questions and tackling the problems or opportunities of your ICT project requires research and
	often a combination of various ICT research methods. The toolkit on this website offers you a set
	of possible research methods and a framework to select the appropriate (combination of) methods.
</p>

<!--
<p>
	But to be honest: a wiki is not fun to use and who buys a pack, lol. Because of that reason this
	app is created. It's a fun an intuitive way of getting information about the research methods.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>
	The creator of this app does not own any of this content. All the ICT Research Methods are
	available via the official <a href="https://ictresearchmethods.nl/Main_Page" target="_blank"

<h2>Licensing</h2>

	All of its contents and the physical Methods pack have been realised as, and are maintained by

<p>The Method cards (except the domain specific cards) were written by:</p>

<p>All Method cards were illustrated by Laura Henneke</p>

<h2>About this app</h2>

<p>
	As mentioned before: all the content is already available, so why this app? Well.. A wiki is not
	fun to use and who buys a pack, lol.
</p>

<p>
	With this app I hope I can encourage students to use the ICT Research Methods in a fun way. You
	can easily search for methods, save your favorite methods to access them later even faster, use
	the app as PWA on your phone and even view your saved methods offline.
</p>
<p>
	Oh and btw, there is a <kbd>CMD</kbd>
	+ <kbd>K</kbd> search and soon a dark mode. I mean: what else do you need.
</p>

<h2>Future</h2>

<p>This app is still in development, so you might see some changes in the near future.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>
	I <a href="https://github.com/jochemvogel/ictmethods.nl" target="_blank">open sourced</a> the project,
	so other people can implement their own improvements. Enjoy! ✌️
