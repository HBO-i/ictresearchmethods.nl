name: "Human impact score"
why: "If you create technology you change people and you change how people look at the world. You make moral decisions. Researching how your technology changes people and designing for that change improves the chance for a technology with the intended (positive) impact and with that the acceptance of the technology as a whole"
how: "Identify the most important aspects of your intended technology on the impact on humans. How is the identity of the (intended) users affected by the technology? How will they change? How does the technology influence the users' autonomy and decision making? What is the effect of the technology on the health and/or well-being of users?"
practice: "A lot of projects create technology that is used in society by humans. More and more organisations realise that understanding the manner in which a technology changes humans improves the chance that the technology leads to the intended positive impact and the acceptance of the application."
ingredients: [
"A genuine interest in understanding the impact of technology on humans.",
"An expert interview with an expert on the relation between humans and technology can be used as input.",
"Frameworks like the Technology Acceptance Model or the Theory of planned behaviour.",
"Tools like TICT.io or tools by the Center of Human Technology."
