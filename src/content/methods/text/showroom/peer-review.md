name: "Peer review"
why: "Colleagues and experts can help improve your work, especially if they need to reuse it."
how: "Organise a representative group of experts and have them look at your work in a structured way. Peer reviews can be done in formal and less formal ways. What makes or breaks the review is getting the right colleagues or experts and giving them the right instructions for looking at and reporting about your work."
practice: "There are many forms of peer review in practice, ranging from a quick (but structured) glance at your work by a colleague to a full session with multiple experts who watch you talk them through your work on a big screen."
ingredients: [
"Somewhere between 1 and 10 colleagues or other (external) experts.",
"A way to show your work (e.g. a big screen or printouts).",
"Review instructions and reporting guidelines.",
"A laptop to make notes of your own observations and conclusions."
