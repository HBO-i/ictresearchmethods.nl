name: "Product review"
why: "Ensure that the product is perfect before it is released to the client or users."
how: "One or more representatives of the client and other experts do a walk-through of the final product before it is released. This ensures that the product meets pre-set quality standards, and that all agreed-upon requirements are part of the product. A product demonstration is often part of this exercise."
practice: "Agile methodologies like Scrum explicitly make reviews or demos part of the process. This ensures that after every sprint iteration, the client and development team are aware of the projectâ€™s status and of the goals or requirements that are not yet met."
ingredients: [
"One or more representatives of the client and/or other experts.",
"A well-prepared demonstration that shows all the relevant parts of the product.",
"Sufficient time (half an hour to several hours) to do a demonstration and walk-through.",
"The list of product requirements."
