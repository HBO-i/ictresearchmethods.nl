name: "Usability testing"
why: "Detect problems users have with your solution and correct them before the system goes live."
how: "You can use a paper or electronic prototype of your solution to test your application in an early stage. Later, you can use your actual solution and test things like interface, performance and how a user executes a typical task. Users are usually asked to think aloud, but you can also get results from automatic measurement tools (e.g. timers, eye trackers, mouse movement tracking and text logging)."
practice: "Because a complete system cannot be tested far before its release, companies typically test parts or early versions in earlier stages, so there is still time to fix things as needed."
ingredients: [
"A prototype (paper or electronic).",
"A quiet room with the user.",
"Tools for automatically gathering data (may be embedded in your solution).",
"Video or audio recording equipment."
