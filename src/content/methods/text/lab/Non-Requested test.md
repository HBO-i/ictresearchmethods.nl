name: "Non-Requested test"
why: "The way the client has formulated their requirements is usually not the way that users interact with the system. Also the client doesn't always thinks about systems that are needed. like backups."
how: "Non-Requestedâ€™ refers to aspects of the software (e.g. scalability or security) that may not be related to a specific function or user action (e.g. How many people can log in at once?). You need to test whether the system fulfills requirements related to usability, reliability, performance and supportability"
practice: "To ensure that users accept a solution, companies confirm that the product not only offers the required functions, but also does so in a practical and safe way."
ingredients: [
"(Customer) test situations.",
"An open mind about what compatibility and recovery mean.",
