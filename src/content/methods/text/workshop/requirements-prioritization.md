name: "Requirements prioritization"
why: "To define and weigh the requirements of a new design or redesign, considering the interest of all concerned stakeholders."
how: "Gather requirements by interviewing and studying stakeholders and their contexts. Determine whether requirements are clear and complete. Identify priorities together with stakeholders. Requirement lists could include requirements for the user, design, context, architecture, technical aspects or performance. Requirements can be written as a list, or explained in the form of user stories."
practice: "Requirement lists are typical for large projects and are used for release planning. To minimize risk during development, the most important high-risk requirements are implemented first"
ingredients: [
"An analytic view.",
"The ability to write clear, unambiguous requirements.",
"A way to indicate priorities (e.g. MoSCoW or a backlog)."
