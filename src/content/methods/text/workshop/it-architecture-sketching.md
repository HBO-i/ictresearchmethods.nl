why: "Defining the IT architecture is complex and requires contributions from and interactions between software designers and/or architects. Sketching facilitates these discussions."

practice: "Most companies use architecture sketching at the beginning of the design process, and as a kick-off for major changes to a part of the architecture."
ingredients: [
"The appropriate people (3â€“5 people with the required expertise is ideal).",
"An understanding of the top-level requirements before starting.",
"A whiteboard and markers.",
"A camera to photograph the resulting sketch to detail later."
