name: "Decomposition"
why: "Breaking a complex IT system or problem into smaller parts ensures its maintainability and robustness, and facilitates cooperation in large-scale software projects."
how: "Create a model of your system by breaking it into components, and then defining relationships. You can define models from different perspectives (e.g. static, dynamic and physical views)."
practice: "Large companies use a wide repertoire of techniques (e.g. UML, SysML, C4 Model), while smaller companies often use a subset of these techniques. The extent to which these techniques are used depends on the needs in a project and can differ for various parts of the software."
ingredients: [
"A ‘divide and conquer’ mindset.",
"An appropriate modelling technique, like UML.",
"Knowledge of some (not all) of the requirements.",
"Knowledge of the end system and what changes are expected in the future (variation points)."
