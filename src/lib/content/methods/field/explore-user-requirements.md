name: "Explore user requirements (test)"
why: "Get a detailed view of how users will be using your solution and what their requirements are."
how: "Talk to your clients about their expectations and describe how the different users (or stakeholders) will interact with the system under development. It is highly recommended that you directly involve end users, rather than just the client."
practice: "Most companies build their work on what others have already done. This happens a lot in the open source community, but also in commercial products."
ingredients: [
"A list of available products that have some overlap with the one you intend to build.",
"Someone with experience in using or developing similar products (could be yourself).",
"Eagerness to find partial solutions developed by others.",
"An open view: a near-fit might be sufficient to consider."
