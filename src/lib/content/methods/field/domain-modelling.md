name: "Domain modelling"
why: "Map the domain that your product will be part of, so you know the key concepts and the relations between them."
how: "Talk to stakeholders in the field, and iteratively create a conceptual model of the domain in which the concepts and relations are as clear (or formal) as possible. Make sure to look at the domain from different angles."
practice: "One of the first steps in an analysis is often the creation of a domain model: once you know you understand the domain, you can perform subsequent steps."
ingredients: [
"One, or preferably multiple, knowledgeable stakeholders.",
"A technique for capturing the domain in a model, possibly the UML class diagram.",
"Eagerness to find partial solutions developed by others.",
"Sufficient time to go through several iterations."
